## The Math

$$
(p, v) = f_\theta(s), \quad l = (z - v)^2 - \pi \cdot \log p + c \cdot \lVert \theta \rVert^2
$$

- **Neural network parameters $θ$**:
  - These are the settings or knobs of a machine that control how the network processes information.
- **Predicted outcome vt**:
  - This refers to the app's guess or prediction about a specific outcome, such as whether it will rain or not in a weather app.
- **Game outcome z**:
  - In games like rock-paper-scissors, the game outcome indicates whether you win, lose, or tie based on your chosen move and your opponent's move.
- **Error**:
  - It represents the difference between an estimated value and the actual value, like the difference between your estimated height of a tree and its true height.
- **Policy vector pt**:
  - This is a set of instructions or rules guiding decision-making, similar to a strategy for playing cards based on specific conditions.
- **Search probabilities πt**:
  - These probabilities represent the likelihood of taking different paths or options when searching for the best route, similar to a navigation app considering traffic and distance.
- **Gradient descent**:
  - It is a technique for finding the steepest downhill path, analogous to taking small steps in the direction of the steepest slope to reach the bottom faster.
- **Loss function l**:
  - A scoring system that measures performance by evaluating the difference between desired and actual outcomes.
- **Mean-squared error**:
  - It quantifies the average squared difference between estimated values and actual values, often used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions or estimations.
- **Cross-entropy loss**:
  - This loss function measures how surprised you are by the correct outcome compared to your guesses, taking into account the assigned probabilities for each outcome.
